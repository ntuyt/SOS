**SOS: Sequence-of-Sequences Model for 3D Object Recognition** Tan Yu, Zhou Ren, Yuncheng Li, Enxu Yan, Ning Xu, Jianxiong Yin, Simon See, Junsong Yuan 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for training and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
Pytorch

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

### Data Prepare

You need download ModelNet40 dataset


with orientation assumption, 6-view settings
```
Give the example
```

without orientation assumption, 20-view settings
```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
